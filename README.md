# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description
This project is the first step towards building a full web application of the AirBnB clone. It includes a custom command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects, such as users, places, reviews, and more. The goal is to understand how to build the foundational components of a web app including data models, storage engines, and command interpreters.

## Command Interpreter

### How to Start the Command Interpreter
You can start the command interpreter in interactive mode by running the following command:
```bash
./console.py
